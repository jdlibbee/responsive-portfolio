                <p>My name is Justin Libbee and I grew up Reno, NV where I studied baking and pastry, and worked in the culinary
                    industry. I moved to Lake Powell and worked at Boat Rentals during the Summer. After the Summer season
                    ended I moved to Park City, and loved it so much that I decided to stay in Utah. After 5 Winters in Park
                    City, I moved to the Salt Lake valley.</p>
                <p>After moving to the Salt Lake valley I started working in customer service at 1800-Contacts where I was a
                    supervisor, and a part time trainer. I spent 2 years at 1800 Contacts, and was not able to grow more
                    with the company, so I found a start up called Jet.com where I started in customer service on the phones.
                    I shortly moved over to the Tactical Operations and Product Catalog team. On my team we work with developers
                    back East to help correct any issues with the order flow, communicate with members and merchants in regard
                    to orders, as well as correct listing issues on the site. I'm in the bootcamp to help learn web development,
                    and see where it can take me.</p>
                <p>I am a big nerd at heart. I love all of the superhero movies, as well as all of the Lord of the Rings and
                    Hobbit movies. I'm a big anime fan, but it's the typical anime that most Americans enjoy. My favorite
                    stuio is Studio Ghibli, with my most favorite movie being Princess Mononoke.</p>
